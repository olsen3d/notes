# **Information Visualization: Advanced Techniques**

### Geographical Data

* **Spacial Objects** \- counties\, regions\, buildings\, lakes
    * geographical shape and extent that matters for the viz
    * the map is the main object of interest
    * states of the USA each state is a spacial object
    * roads on a map
* **Non-Spatial Geolocated** \- cars\, animals\, weather stations
    * shape does not matter
    * map is used as a reference to see where these objects are located
    * a dot on a map that represents a bike in manhattan map

###### Types of gerographical data
<br>
* **Regions** \- country borders
* **Locations** \- lat and lng
* **Identifiers** \- zipcode\, street name\, borough

Geocoding - identifier > loaction (bike station id get the lat/lng)
Reverse Geocoding - location > identifier (mark a location on a map and give it a bike station identifier)
