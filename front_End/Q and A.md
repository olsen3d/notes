# Recruiter questions to answer
<br>
<br>
## Tell me about yourself?

* **Current**: what do you do currently?
* **Past**: I have about 10 years or so of experience in Computer Aniimation, from a little bit of video gfames to automotive visualizations for Mercedes to architectural visualizations for Wework
* **Future**: I began coding at Wework and went to fullstack

<br>
<br>
## What do you do currently?

**I am a senior lead in the visualization department at WeWork**

I lead 2 main parts of the department:

* **Architectural Renders** - I work with the mid and junior artists to develop future Wework spaces which can involve still renders to interactive 360s and virtual reality
* **Marketing Materials** \- I work with the marketing department to develop animations to promote new spaces\, subscriptions and features of Wework app

In addition to that I write scripts and tools for the team (in **Maxscript** which is similar to and also supports **Python)** that will loop over and process data recieved from the architects.

So I have a few different roles and float around wherever I am needed most.

Soft skills included in (myslef and) my role:

* **Adaptability** to the many different tasks at hand.
* **Communication** with the junior artists and the creative director on the marketing team.
* **Problem Solving** how to best process data for my team.

<br>
<br>
## Why do you want to leave your position?

**Short answer**: I want to persue a career in front end engineering. I have been honing my skills in my freetime and **I am eager** to apply them to the real world.

**Long answer**: Wework has been very accomodating and has a very good learning atmosphere where we are encouraged to learn new skills and I have been focusing on coding tools for my team. While I am able to perfect our workflow and really dive deep into our work. It is still a wework every time. I want some **more challenge** and I want to **problem solve**. I want to l**earn from a good team of engineers.**
<br>
## What are some projects you've worked on recently?

**Moneyclip** \- my latest project as shown on my portfolio website \([www.olsen.dev](http://www.olsen.dev)) and on my github.

Things I liked in this project:

* Creating **modular components** \- graphs work with different types of accounts\. And in different areas of the application
* Creating a s**tyle framework** \- Taking the project from inception to picking a color scheme  and designing logos up to the layout of components and UI\.
* Working on a project with **D3** \- I really like data visualization and creating all the charts and graphs that go with it\.

Things that were challenging:

* When **syncing and seeding** data I needed to use websockets to update a progress bar on the frontend.
* Working with **D3 and React** \- both try to control the dom so it was interesting figuring out who gets control of what\.

<br>
All Access - last marketing project for Wework

* I liked pitching ideas to the creative director and coming up with interesting solutions
* Seeing my product out in the real world is very rewarding.

## What are you looking for in your next role?

most important is Room to grow
I want a company where im not the 3rd person but also not the 50,000th person

second is I want to **solve challenging problems** and face new and exciting **problems to solve**.

I want to be at a company where I can work on a lot of different parts of the pipeline ( I don't want to be a cog in the wheel of a large tech company). I want to learn learn learn. I never want to be stagnant I want to keep moving forward.
<br>
## Compensation

First ask what the budget is for this role.

In my research this role is worth $90,000 - $120,000 while I fall on the lower end of the experience for this role, it is a specific set of skills and I possess many of them in some capacity.

My number (range): **$90,000 to $100,000**. I am definitely willing to negotiate depending on equity (startup) and bonuses/raises within a year. And after hearing a little more about the position.

My lowest possible before walking away: **$85,000**
<br>
## Why do you want to work for this company?

  I want a front end position, I just did a finance related project and really liked it, I want to learn and be able to move up in my position.
<br>

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Prescreen questions to answer: \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

What is the difference between const, let, and var?
  const is immutable - its type can't be changed. It is modifyable though - you can add to an     array and you can add props to an object.
  let you can change the pointer to whatever you want and it will be scoped to whatever the closure it is in
  var is an old one it is hoisted to the top

Explain prototypical inheritance?
  Javascript has a baseline prototype that all objects inherit from. Say you have a class called computer with some properties like year and hard drive size. You can extend that class called Macbook it will inherit those properties and functions and then built upon them with its own.

What does 'this' mean?
  It refers to the current scope that are you are in. If you are in no scope then it is a reference to the window.

What is the data structure of the DOM
  It is a tree

What is a stack?
  Last In First Out - like the call stack

What is a queue?
  First In First Out

How would you implement those in javascript?
  With an array. push in to end of stack pop off a stack
  push in to end of queue shift off beginning of a queue

How can you tell if an image element is loaded on a page?
  The is an onload on an image that will fire with a callback when it is loaded.

What are call and apply?
  They are ways of changing the scope of a function. The first parameter is 'this'

What is event delegation?
  you could apply an event handler to every single element you want to have. Or using event delegation you could say I wanna have one event listener, and thats at the top. When you click
  on something it just bubbles up to the top to the parent that handles the event.
  note: event listeners are very expensive on a page. so it is better to have one event handler vs 60 for performance reasons

What is a worker? when would you use one?
  A worker is something you would use to offload computationally expensive work to a different thread. You can send expensive tasks so the main thread isnt blocking the UI

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Code Test \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Make your code as readable as possible.
Write comments
Dont overcomplicate
Dont import too many libraries
If you have time do some tests
Ask questions

Big O - Given the worst case scenario this is the longest time a funciton is going to take to complete. (based off the input)

Big Omega - best case

Big Theta - average case

Ask questions - just like in real life you will have a back and forth with your coworkers. They cant solve it for you but ask questions.
Talk out your solution. Talk out loud the whole time. No awkward silences
Get comfortable with the environment - codepen etc. you can ask ahead of time what the environment is.

It is costly to keep appending childs to the DOM - if you need to do that for example a list then append them all to a document fragment document.createDocumentFragment() then just append that fragment.

get better at writing code on paper/white board
ask what style the technical questions will be

Strings - a primitive type - useful methods split() toLowerCase() subString() startsWith() - they are immutable. so if you are changing it it costs memory. generally if you are manipulating a string it is better to split into an array and then do what you need to do and then join it back into an array.

Reverse a string

Arrays = Object.entries(), Array.from(), [...item]
