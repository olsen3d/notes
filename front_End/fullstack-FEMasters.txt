What is the internet

Internet - a system of globally interconnected devices.
Intranet - a private internet (a VPN)
LAN - Local Area Network

How does it work

A series of protocols everybody agreed to

IP - Internet Protocol
IP Address - a label assigned to an internet connected device
addresses are used by the internet protocol
IPv4 - 8.8.8.8 4.3 billion addresses
IPv6 - 2001:4860:4860:8888 340 undecillion addresses

TCP - Transmission Control Protocol - has things like error checking
UDP - User Datagram Protocol - assume it gets there - one way 

ping twitter.com

DNS - Domain name system - another protocol icann controls this - an internet phone book
      finds the closest server for this website


blog.jemyoung.com - subdomain
jemyoung.com - Domain
.com - TLD

TLD - top level domain - owned by compaines and countries

why subdomain? - it allows you to partition your data might look like a new website or a different app but still part of the site.

Nameservers - map domains to ip addresses - the record keepers of the internet
