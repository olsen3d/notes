What is the internet

Internet - a system of globally interconnected devices.
Intranet - a private internet (a VPN)
LAN - Local Area Network

How does it work

A series of protocols everybody agreed to

IP - Internet Protocol
IP Address - a label assigned to an internet connected device
addresses are used by the internet protocol
IPv4 - 8.8.8.8 4.3 billion addresses
IPv6 - 2001:4860:4860:8888 340 undecillion addresses

TCP - Transmission Control Protocol - has things like error checking
UDP - User Datagram Protocol - assume it gets there - one way 

ping twitter.com

DNS - Domain name system - another protocol icann controls this - an internet phone book
      finds the closest server for this website


blog.jemyoung.com - subdomain
jemyoung.com - Domain
.com - TLD

TLD - top level domain - owned by compaines and countries

why subdomain? - it allows you to partition your data might look like a new website or a different app but still part of the site.

Nameservers - map domains to ip addresses - the record keepers of the internet

Trace Routes - traceroute google.com passed along from server to server until it gets to dest. hops
        helps to diagnose network problems. if it fails at like hop 2 then the ISP is probably down

ICMP - traceroute and ping - Internet Control Message Protocol - sort of health checks - you can configure not to respond to these at all
    or you can blackhole - just dont respond

Packet - a small bit of information - mainly contains metadata - where its going where it came from (headers) TCP gets packets and has error correction UDP packets are just broadcasts 

How does the internet work? it runs over TCP/IP protocols and on those protocols are packets that contain information - a series of trusts to hand off data to the next person. if it type in a website that gets resolved by a nameserver to a server that handles the data.

Net neutrality says that the trust is broken - an ISP can say if a packet is going to ex. sri lanka - they can tax it at a different rate or make it go faster or slower


VIM - Vi Improved - a text editor - VI is good because it is on almost every server. You wont always be able to open things in vscode - no mouse

VIM modes - 
	Insert mode - i - editing text
command mode - ESC - copy paste etc.
	Last line mode - : - searching saving exiting

How to open VIM - vi in bash
How to quit VIM - ESC :q!
Save/write - :w

Server - what does a server do? - serves content - responds to requests - anything really can be a server

vi simpleserver.js

server sits in a datacenter your request will probably go through headers

The Cloud - let someone else manage the server hardware - distributed globally so its faster and a shorter distance to route - you want the minimum amount of hops.

Elastic computing - scales as needed - you can just get more servers from the data centers - costs adjust with traffic.

VPS - slice a server to what are you are using $5 a month etc.
digital ocean can host - droplet is virtual server
EC2 is amazon virtual server

Linux - linux - ubuntu
  kernel - talks to cpu etc.
  utilites - apps that do one thing they can be updated without breaking anything
choose an LTS version - Long Term Support

SSH - a type of user authentication - Secure Socket Shell - key pair a public ket and a private key
your computer has private key and the public key is in the server. everything is encrypted and goes through a "tunnel"

SSH Key ~/.ssh ls ssh-keygen - makes a private and a public key
ssh root@174.138.47.198 - to log in
ssh -i fsfe - the private key to use 
ssh -i fsfe root@174.138.47.198
exit - to exit the server

dont use root in ubuntu

buy a domain - namecheap, google, godaddy

DNS records 
  A records - map name to an ip address - mike.com > 23.23.185.61
  CNAME - maps name to name - blog.mike.com > 23.23.185.61

dig olsen.dev - show all the records for website

fractalsare.cool on google domains

add 2 A Records with your IP address @ and www
use digital ocean to add domain
update nameserver on google

on DO add an A record hostname is @, direct to your server, TTL 3600
add an A record hostname www, same server, TTL 3600

server IP - 174.138.47.198

go to google domains and add nameservers from DO there should be 3 of them under your A records



--------------

HTTP
request <---> response

http datagram of a request:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: olsen.dev
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Macintosh Intel
  Safari/537.21
Accept: text/html
Accept-Encoding: gzip, br

A packet is made up of data and metadata - part of the metadata is headers

Headers - what kind of encoding, where its coming from, content type
  GET, Host, User-agent, Accept, etc.
  certain headers are unmidifyable - Host
  User agent - which browser, what features it has, etc. version number
  Set-cookie - sets stateful information
  X - custom headers

Cookie - a piece of metadata that goes on every request - persists on the browser until expiration
        it lets you extend the user ecxperience across sessions. too many cookies can add overhead and slow your requests

a response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/ ubuntu
Date: sep 25th 2019
Content-Type: html/text
Cointent-Length: 12
