Explain error boundaries
  <ErrorBoundaryComp>
    ^ has special lifecycle get state from error
      can have a fallback component
      component did catch


best lifecycle for API calls?
  component did mount


react patterns name some patterns
  context-api pattern
    use context to access props
    <Provider> and <Consumer>
  render props
    use children as functions
  presentation component pattern
    state component and presentational components


Why use react in your project?
  depends on project - if it will take 6 months see if any frameworks have major changes coming. if react hooks is about to come out then maybe use somethinhg else

  angular is one package has testing and routing
  react you need to add all that stuff

  react is pretty plain javascript with no crazy syntax to remember


what is css-in-js pattern
  css is global you can use css modules 
  you can do inline css from in the component


why cant you update state directly without setState()?
  setState will rerender
  copy state modify it and send it to it


how many ways can you conditionally render in react?
  if statement 
  && expression
  ternary operator ? :


what is Fragments and why use it?
  <React.Fragment> will let you render children without a parent like a <div>


how to do code-splitting in react?
  when the bundles creates bundle.js - the whole website gets sent right away
  multiple bundles from dynamic imports
  const lazyComp = React.lazy(() => import('./component')) - this will load async
  <suspense> </suspense>


what are some alternatives to redux?
  mobX
  apollo client + GraphQL
  RxJS


what is redux middleware?
  you add another layer before the next
  action > reducer > store
  a thunk would be middleware
  so the store doesnt update until the server responds


redux saga vs redux thunk
  they are both middleware
  redux thunk makes an action creator


how to optimize a react app?
  ask questions!!!! find out parameters
  this is also about communication!!!
  how big is it how complex? what kind of performance issues?
  a big bundle? memory leaks? jank?

  speed - profiler and find out bottlenecks
    you might be rerendering when not supposed to
    use react memo

  big bundle - use lazy loading or dynamic imports

  might seem slow because APIs are slow - so not really react but you may need to speed up your API calls

  maybe there is a lot of big assets 


explain virtual DOM
  age old question how to update the dom efficiently??
  slow and expensive dom updates
  react has its own dom tree called vdom
  any changes will update the vdom
  and that will only change whats needed in the real dom


fix this for me!
  do - understand whats going on!
  look over it very carefully before starting

  ask questions - is there multiple problems?


add functionality
  tictactoe - design a check for who is the winner
  3x3 matrix change to a 4x4 matrix game

  draw it out and explain the logic 


build something from scratch
  build a todo list add item remove item

  use create-react-app
  divide into components!
  dont make it too fancy focud on functionality


hooks

hooks are functions that can manipulate state etc.
they replace class components with functions so it is more
functional programming with closures

why hooks
  its simpler and more concise
  no more map state to props

hooks rules?
  only call at top level
  dont call in a loop etc.

how to change from class to hooks?
  update react, and react-dom versions
  tests
  do one route or component at a time
  tests


how to debug hooks
  console logic
  debugger
  react developer tools chrome plugin


why is onCLick in react different?
  it handels different browsers for you
  synthetic events
  events are pooled - they are reused
  native events


how does event delegation work in react?
  say you have an onclick on a <li>
  then you have 1000 <li> it woul dbe better to just have one ecvent at the top of the document
  react does this automatically


list hooks
  usestate
  useeffect
  useRef 
  useContext
  uselayoutEffect


best practices for hooks?
  follow the rules
  use a linter
  combine usestates


how often should you update react?
  every 6 or 9 months
  a week dedicated to upgrading



todo list app
searchable dropdown
deeply nested dropdown - api returns nested json

take home jira board like a ticket system
myboard
todo, inprogress, ... done
