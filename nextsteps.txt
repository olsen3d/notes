Hi Tegan, hope you are doing well.

I have 2 questions about some of the open roles you have currently posted if you have a minute to help -

My background and skills outlined below align well with the 3D Lead Engineer position, however I don't have that many years of experience. As for the Full Stack positions, I was wondering if they involve 3D design in any way.

Either way I am interested in your product and would love to learn more!

A little about myself:
I have 10+ years of experience in 3D Visualization - from video games, automotive visualization, and mostly architectural visualization utilizing Unity, 3Ds Max, Vray, Corona, etc. You can see my architectural renderings here: https://www.olsen.dev/archviz

More recently I have a year of experience building Full Stack projects utilizing React, GraphQl, PostgreSQL, and various AWS technologies(S3, CloudFront, Lamba functions, etc.) You can see my projects hosted here: https://www.olsen.dev/softwaredev 

Thank you for your time and hopefully we can explore a potential fit for me into the team!

Mike Olsen - Front end / 3D Visualization - Obsess Frontend Engineer Position

Hi Neha, hope you are doing well.
I am interested in Obsess' concept of virtual stores and I'd love to learn more about the position and the product!
A quick summary of my skills and experience:

I have 10+ years of experience in 3d Visualization from video games to architectural visualization. I also have a year of experience developing applications using React/Redux with unit tests and CI/CD with TravisCI.

Currently at Wework I lead a team that produces 3d rendered virtual tours like this one: https://wework3d.viewin360.co/share/collection/7P5fG that seem to be similar to the concept of your product.

You can view the rest of my work on my portfolio: https://www.olsen.dev

I have also gone ahead and applied for the position via LinkedIn.

Thank you for your time and hope to hear from you soon,

Mike
